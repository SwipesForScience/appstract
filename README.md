# Example Swipes for Science configuration

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SwipesForScience/testConfig.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SwipesForScience/testConfig)

Hello 👋! Thanks for checking out this example Swipes for Science app. This example repo has all you need to configure your own Swipes for Science (S4S) app. 

Specifically, this example shows how to a create an app that annotates images and sounds.
We want citizen scientists to help us classify ocean sounds that have whales 🐋🐳🐬 or not ( 🌊🚢⛵️).

You may notice  that this repo does not contain the main [Swipes for Science codebase](https://github.com/SwipesForScience/SwipesForScience) -- instead, this repo only contains the content needed to customize the S4S app. This prevents your repo from getting too big with files you don't really need to see, and you're also not bogged down with code from older versions of the S4S template. We have a little trick to make sure 
that your app is always up to date with the latest S4S template, by using [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.com) to update and deploy your app. 

Here is a diagram to follow as you set up your own app:
